# Description

This is a multiplayer game of tag made using `godot` as the game engine, `godot-rust` in order to write game logic in rust, and `spacetimedb` to manage the networking, server side compute, and database.

I made this project to experiment with `spacetimedb` and understand it's strengths and limits.

# TODO

- [ ] Architect tables in `spacetimedb` module
- [ ] Implement tables in `spacetimedb` module
- [ ] Architect `spacetimedb` reducers
- [ ] Implement `spacetimedb` reducers
